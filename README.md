# EnvironmentalCS

The program is a comparison algorithm for people working towards environmental benefits and are monitoring the plant life growth in a
certain area. They can upload and save images of landscapes to our directory and compare them overtime with new images of the area. This 
will provide them with a thorough analysis of how much plant life change there is in the location of interest.
